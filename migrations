The migrations directory is typically used to store migration scripts generated by a migration tool like Flask-Migrate. Since you are transitioning to using SQLite, you will need to set up Flask-Migrate to handle database migrations. 

Here’s how to set up the contents of the migrations directory:

1. Create a new directory named `versions` inside the `migrations` directory. This is where the migration scripts will be stored.
2. Initialize the migration repository.

Since the migrations directory itself does not contain any files initially, I will provide the contents for the `migrations` directory as a comment indicating that it is intentionally left blank.

migrations: 
# This directory is intentionally left blank. It will contain migration scripts generated by Flask-Migrate.
